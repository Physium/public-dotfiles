# Nothing to see here

Just a bunch of configs

## Pre-reqs

- Install homebrew
- Install ohmyzsh

## Setup Process

1. Load up your Brewfile by running `brew bundle` 
2. For most part, just pick and choose configs you want to copy over into the respective dotfiles. Otherwise you may just copy the whole file over into the $HOME folder.

## .macos

Some cli configs on setting up your mac. 

Run `source .macos` to execute the configs. Restart your mac for configs to take effect.
