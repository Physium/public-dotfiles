# Nothing to see here

Doing this so that I can get my hands on critical config files just with `git clone`

## Pre-reqs

- Install homebrew
- Install ohmyzsh

## Setup Process

1. Load up your Brewfile by running `brew bundle` 

## .macos

Some cli configs on setting up your mac. 

Run `source .macos` to execute the configs. Restart your mac for configs to take effect.
